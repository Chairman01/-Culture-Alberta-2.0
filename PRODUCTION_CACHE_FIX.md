# Production Cache Fix - New Articles Not Showing

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

Your articles were showing perfectly in development but not appearing in production after deployment to Vercel. This was caused by:

1. **Static Page Generation**: Vercel was building your pages at deploy time and caching them
2. **No Cache Invalidation**: When you created new articles in production, the cached pages weren't being updated
3. **API Route Caching**: API routes weren't explicitly configured to disable caching

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

I've implemented **automatic page revalidation** that triggers whenever articles are created, updated, or deleted.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **`app/api/articles/route.ts`**
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` and `export const revalidate = 0` to disable API caching
- Added automatic `revalidatePath()` calls after:
  - **Creating** a new article
  - **Updating** an existing article
  - **Deleting** an article
- This ensures all pages are immediately refreshed with new content

#### 2. **`app/api/revalidate/route.ts`**
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent caching

#### 3. **`app/api/refresh-cache/route.ts`**
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent caching

#### 4. **`app/api/sync-articles/route.ts`**
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent caching
- Added direct `revalidatePath()` calls after syncing articles from Supabase
- Replaced indirect revalidation (via fetch) with direct Next.js cache revalidation

## How It Works Now üöÄ

### When You Create a New Article:

1. You create an article in the admin panel
2. Article is saved to Supabase ‚úÖ
3. **Automatic revalidation** triggers immediately ‚úÖ
4. All pages are refreshed:
   - Homepage (`/`)
   - Edmonton page (`/edmonton`)
   - Calgary page (`/calgary`)
   - Food & Drink page (`/food-drink`)
   - Events page (`/events`)
   - Articles page (`/articles`)
5. **New article appears instantly on production!** üéâ

### When You Update or Delete an Article:

Same process - automatic revalidation ensures pages show the latest content immediately.

## Testing Instructions üß™

### Step 1: Deploy to Production

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Add automatic page revalidation for new articles"
git push origin master
```

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
Wait for Vercel to finish deploying (usually 1-2 minutes).

### Step 3: Test Creating a New Article

1. Go to your production admin panel: `https://your-domain.com/admin/articles`
2. Create a new test article with:
   - Title: "Production Test Article - [Current Time]"
   - Category: Choose "Calgary" or "Edmonton" or "Food & Drink"
   - Content: "Testing production article visibility"
   - Status: "Published"
3. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Check the Homepage

1. Open a new incognito/private browser window
2. Go to your production homepage: `https://your-domain.com`
3. **Your new article should appear immediately!** ‚úÖ

### Step 5: Verify All Sections

Check that your article appears in:
- Homepage (if featured)
- City pages (Edmonton/Calgary based on category)
- Food & Drink section (if that's the category)
- Articles list page

## Additional Tools üõ†Ô∏è

### Manual Cache Refresh (If Needed)

If for some reason automatic revalidation doesn't work, you can manually refresh the cache:

**Option 1: Via Browser**
```
https://your-domain.com/api/refresh-cache
```

**Option 2: Via Terminal**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/refresh-cache
```

### Check Current Articles

To see what's in your Supabase database:
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/articles
```

## Why This Fix Works üéØ

1. **`revalidate = 0`**: Tells Next.js not to cache the data
2. **`dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`**: Forces server-side rendering on every request
3. **`revalidatePath('/', 'layout')`**: Clears the entire app cache
4. **Individual path revalidation**: Ensures each page gets fresh data

## Common Issues & Solutions üîß

### Issue: "Articles still not showing"
**Solution**: 
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try incognito/private browsing mode
3. Check Vercel logs to confirm revalidation is running

### Issue: "Old cached version shows for 5 minutes"
**Solution**: 
- This is Vercel's CDN cache
- Run manual refresh: `https://your-domain.com/api/refresh-cache`

### Issue: "Getting errors when creating articles"
**Solution**: 
- Check Vercel function logs for errors
- Verify Supabase connection is working
- Ensure environment variables are set in Vercel

## Monitoring üìä

### Check Vercel Logs

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Functions" tab
4. Look for these success messages:
   ```
   üîÑ Revalidating pages after article creation...
   ‚úÖ Pages revalidated successfully
   ```

### Verify in Browser Console

When you create/update articles, you should see the API calls succeed with:
```json
{
  "id": "article-...",
  "title": "Your Article Title",
  ...
}
```

## Performance Impact ‚ö°

- **No negative impact**: Revalidation happens asynchronously
- **First visit after update**: Generates fresh page (takes ~1-2 seconds)
- **Subsequent visits**: Served from cache until next update
- **No increased database calls**: Same number of queries as before

## Next Steps After Testing ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ Test creating a new article in production
2. ‚úÖ Verify it shows on homepage immediately
3. ‚úÖ Test updating an article
4. ‚úÖ Test deleting an article
5. ‚úÖ Monitor for 24 hours to ensure stability

## Rollback Plan (If Needed) üîÑ

If something goes wrong, revert with:

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin master
```

Then the old caching behavior will return, and you can troubleshoot further.

## Questions?

If articles still don't show:
1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test the `/api/refresh-cache` endpoint manually
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**This fix ensures your production site always shows the latest articles immediately after creation, just like development!** üéâ
