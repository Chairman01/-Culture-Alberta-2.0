# Production Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve production issues with the Culture Alberta website.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Slow Article Loading
**Problem**: Database queries were taking too long (10+ seconds) causing slow page loads.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Reduced database query timeouts from 10 seconds to 2-3 seconds in production
- Implemented dynamic cache duration (3 minutes in production vs 10 minutes in development)
- Added production-specific query optimizations
- Improved fallback mechanisms for faster error recovery

### 2. Admin Changes Not Updating
**Problem**: Admin changes weren't reflecting immediately due to aggressive caching.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Enhanced cache clearing mechanism after create/update operations
- Added immediate cache invalidation for admin operations
- Implemented production-specific cache settings
- Added force refresh for admin operations

### 3. Font Features Not Working in Admin
**Problem**: TipTap editor font family and size features weren't working in production due to CSS conflicts.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed CSS specificity issues in the RichTextEditor component
- Updated font rendering in preview mode
- Added proper CSS classes for custom font styling
- Improved font feature compatibility across environments

## Files Modified

### Core Performance Files
- `lib/supabase-articles.ts` - Database query optimizations and caching
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Production-specific Supabase configuration
- `lib/production-optimizations.ts` - New file with production-specific settings

### Admin Interface Files
- `app/admin/components/rich-text-editor.tsx` - Font feature fixes
- `next.config.js` - Production optimizations and headers

### New Files Created
- `lib/production-optimizations.ts` - Production-specific configurations
- `PRODUCTION_FIXES.md` - This documentation

## Production Optimizations

### Database Performance
- Reduced query timeouts for faster fallbacks
- Implemented dynamic caching based on environment
- Added production-specific connection settings
- Optimized realtime settings for production

### Caching Strategy
- **Development**: 10-minute cache duration, 5-second timeouts
- **Production**: 3-minute cache duration, 2-second timeouts
- Immediate cache invalidation for admin operations
- Aggressive caching for better performance

### Security Headers
- Added security headers for production
- Implemented proper CSP policies
- Added cache control headers for API routes

### Image Optimization
- Enabled WebP and AVIF formats in production
- Added proper image caching headers
- Optimized image loading performance

## Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in production:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NODE_ENV=production
VERCEL=1
VERCEL_ENV=production
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. ✅ Verify all environment variables are set
2. ✅ Test admin functionality locally
3. ✅ Verify font features work in admin editor
4. ✅ Check database connection performance
5. ✅ Test article loading speeds
6. ✅ Verify cache invalidation works
7. ✅ Test admin updates reflect immediately

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

- Page load times (should be < 3 seconds)
- Database query performance
- Admin update response times
- Font feature functionality
- Cache hit rates

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:

1. Revert to previous deployment
2. Check environment variables
3. Verify Supabase connection
4. Test with reduced cache duration
5. Monitor error logs

## Performance Expectations

After these fixes:

- **Article Loading**: < 3 seconds (down from 10+ seconds)
- **Admin Updates**: Immediate reflection (down from delayed updates)
- **Font Features**: Fully functional in production
- **Cache Performance**: 3-minute cache with immediate invalidation
- **Database Queries**: 2-second timeout with fast fallbacks

## Support

If you encounter any issues after deployment:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify environment variables are correct
3. Test database connectivity
4. Check cache invalidation logs
5. Monitor production performance metrics
